# Introduction
This is  collection of simple LEGO linkages that can follow a prescribed motion
created with the [LEGO Digital Designer (LDD)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd) 4.3,
a free application for Windows and Mac. (Linux users may want to use [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/products/crossover-linux)
to run LDD with emulation.)

The linkages are built from a minimal set of LEGO parts. The focus is that all
linkages can be built quickly and their movement can be traced on a piece of
paper. See author's presentation with title [Teaching algebra and geometry with LEGO and linkages](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332303931_Teaching_algebra_and_geometry_with_LEGO_and_linkages)
on further details on the topic.

## The linkages
### Peaucellier's linkage
Peaucellier's linkage provides a linear motion when putting a pen refill in the top-right position.
