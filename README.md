# Introduction
This is  collection of simple LEGO linkages that can follow a prescribed motion
created with the [LEGO Digital Designer (LDD)](https://www.lego.com/en-us/ldd) 4.3,
a free application for Windows and Mac. (Linux users may want to use [CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/products/crossover-linux)
to run LDD with emulation.)

The linkages are built from a minimal set of LEGO parts. The focus is that all
linkages can be built quickly and their movement can be traced on a piece of
paper. See author's presentation with title [Teaching algebra and geometry with LEGO and linkages](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332303931_Teaching_algebra_and_geometry_with_LEGO_and_linkages)
on further details on the topic.

## The linkages

### Peaucellier's linkage

Peaucellier's linkage provides a linear motion when putting a pen refill in the top-right position.

See also [Building Instructions](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kovzol/lego-linkages/blob/master/html/Building%20Instructions%20%5BPeaucellier%5D.html).
A [GeoGebra applet](https://www.geogebra.org/m/dhpbsjdB) is also available that can be changed a little bit
to get exactly the same motion: *l<sub>1</sub>* has to be set to 8 and *l<sub>2</sub>* to 4 units. Then,
by showing the output labelled with *a* we learn that radius of the circle needs to be 3 units.

Unfortunately there exists no LEGO beam with 3 units (that is, with 4 holes), so we need to use a bigger one.
Here a 4 units long beam is used (with 5 holes). The basic kit (explained in the author's presentation
on page 93 in the Shopping list slide) has to be extended by two blue long pins, one white 5 holes beam
and one black 5 holes beam.

(Alternatively a 3 units long beam with 4 holes could be printed with a 3D printer instead of the black 5 holes beam.)
